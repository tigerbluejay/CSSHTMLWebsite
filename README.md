# CSS HTML PHP Website - My First Large Web Development Project

This project represents my first full-scale web development effort, combining HTML, CSS, and PHP to build a multi-page, responsive website from the ground up. It features a structured layout with reusable components, basic interactivity, and dynamic content rendering using PHP. The site demonstrates my foundational understanding of frontend and backend integration, emphasizing clear code organization and visual coherence. This project was instrumental in building my confidence as a developer and marked a significant step in my learning journey.
